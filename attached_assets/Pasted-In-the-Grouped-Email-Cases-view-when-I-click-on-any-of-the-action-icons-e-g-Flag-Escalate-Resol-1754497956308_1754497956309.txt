In the Grouped Email Cases view, when I click on any of the action icons (e.g. Flag, Escalate, Resolve, etc.), currently nothing happens. Here's what I need:

Expected Behavior of Action Icons:

When I click on an action icon (e.g., Flag), the selected grouped email case should be:

Moved to the corresponding dashboard (e.g., the Flagged Emails dashboard).

Removed from the Grouped Email Cases view, as it has now been processed.

Whitelist Sender Functionality:

I would like to add a whitelist action icon.

When clicked:

The sender's email address should be added to a global whitelist list.

The email case should also be removed from the Grouped Email Cases view.

Additionally, this whitelist should be:

Integrated into the data import workflow, so that any future imports automatically exclude emails from whitelisted senders during processing.

Let me know if you need this broken down into implementation tasks or user stories.

Here’s an updated and clearer version of your full request, optimized for Replit and ready for implementation or planning:

Feature Request for Replit – Action Icons, Whitelisting, and Admin View Enhancements

1. Grouped Email Cases – Action Icons Functionality
When I click on an action icon (e.g. Flag, Escalate, Resolve) in the Grouped Email Cases view:

The selected grouped email case must be moved to the corresponding dashboard (e.g. Flagged Emails).

It should no longer appear in Grouped Email Cases, since it's been actioned.

Each action should only affect that case, not all grouped items unless selected.

2. Whitelist Sender Email Functionality
I want to add a new Whitelist Sender action icon in the Grouped Email Cases view.

When clicked:

The sender’s email address should be added to a Whitelist.

That case should be removed from Grouped Email Cases (like other actions).

This whitelist must be persisted (e.g. in a JSON file).

3. Import Workflow Integration
During new data imports, the system must:

Automatically exclude emails from whitelisted sender addresses.

The rest of the import process (rule engine, ML, etc.) should continue as usual for non-whitelisted emails.

4. Admin Dashboard – Manage Whitelisted Senders
In the Admin Dashboard, I need a new view/section called Whitelist Senders (or Whitelist Domains if both domains and full emails are supported).

This view should allow me to:

View all whitelisted sender email addresses

Add new whitelisted email addresses manually

Edit existing ones

Remove senders from the whitelist
