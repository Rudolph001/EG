# Email Guardian Adaptive ML System Guide

## 🧠 What is Adaptive ML?

The Adaptive ML system is an intelligent learning engine that **gets smarter every time you make decisions**. Instead of using fixed rules, it learns from your escalation and clearing choices to become more accurate at predicting security threats.

## 📊 How It Works (Simple Visual Flow)

```
📥 New Email Dataset

## 🔄 Learning Cycle

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Base Model)
- System uses standard threat detection (Isolation Forest)
- Assigns basic risk scores to all emails
- **Adaptive Weight: 10%** (mostly base model)

### Phase 2: Your Decisions Matter
- You escalate suspicious emails → System learns "risky patterns"
- You clear safe emails → System learns "safe patterns"
- Every decision trains the AI to match your judgment

### Phase 3: Adaptive Learning
- After 10 decisions → Model starts adapting
- After 50+ decisions → **Adaptive Weight grows to 70%**
- System becomes highly tuned to your security preferences

## 🎯 What the System Learns About

### ⚡ High-Risk Patterns It Discovers:
- **Attachment Types**: `.exe`, `.scr` files from external domains
- **Subject Lines**: "URGENT", "Payment Required", "Account Suspended"
- **Sender Behavior**: External domains during off-hours
- **Leaver Activity**: Former employees sending attachments
- **Content Patterns**: Invoices, wire transfers, confidential documents

### ✅ Safe Patterns It Recognizes:
- **Internal Communications**: HR announcements, team updates
- **Routine Business**: Meeting notes, policy updates
- **Trusted Partners**: Regular vendor communications
- **Time Patterns**: Normal business hours activity

## 📈 Performance Evolution

| Stage | Decisions Made | Adaptive Weight | Accuracy |
|-------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Initial** | 0-9 | 10% | Base Level |
| **Learning** | 10-29 | 15-25% | Improving |
| **Adapting** | 30-49 | 30-50% | Good |
| **Mature** | 50+ | 50-70% | Excellent |

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide for Your App

### Step 1: Recording User Decisions

When a user escalates or clears a case, record the feedback:

```python
# When user clicks "Escalate" or "Clear"
feedback = MLFeedback(
    session_id=session_id,
    record_id=record.record_id,
    user_decision='Escalated',  # or 'Cleared'
    original_ml_score=record.ml_risk_score,
    decision_timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
)
db.session.add(feedback)
db.session.commit()
```

### Step 2: Triggering Learning

**Automatic Learning** (Recommended):
```python
# Learn every 10 decisions
if decisions_count % 10 == 0:
    adaptive_ml_engine.learn_from_user_decisions(session_id)
```

**Manual Learning** (Via API):
```python
# POST /api/adaptive-learning/trigger/{session_id}
response = requests.post(f'/api/adaptive-learning/trigger/{session_id}')
```

### Step 3: Using Adaptive Results

**Enhanced Analysis**:
```python
# Use adaptive analysis instead of base ML
results = adaptive_ml_engine.analyze_session_with_learning(session_id)
```

**Updated Risk Scores**:
- Records get hybrid scores (base + adaptive)
- Risk levels automatically adjust based on learning
- Explanations include adaptive confidence levels

## 📊 Monitoring Learning Progress

### Dashboard Metrics to Track:
- **Model Maturity**: Initial → Learning → Adapting → Mature
- **Adaptive Weight**: 10% → 70% (higher = more personalized)
- **Decision Count**: Total escalations + clears processed
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of emails you typically escalate

### Key Performance Indicators:
- **Learning Confidence**: How sure the model is about patterns
- **Feature Importance**: Which email attributes matter most to you
- **Pattern Recognition**: Top risk indicators discovered
